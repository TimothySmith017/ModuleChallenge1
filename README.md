After conducting my analyses, there are a number of conclusions and suggestions that can be made regarding the findings of the analyses. First, I'll start with the conclusions that can be made.

* The first conclusion that can be made comes from this chart depicting the % of outcomes from Kickstarter campaigns based on their starting goal. One clear observation is that campaigns that lower campaign goals, such as those less than $1,000 or inbetween $1,000 and $4,999, had a much higher success rate than other campaigns. These campaigns had a success rate between 60 and 80%. The campaigns that had a goal less than $1,000 were successful 76% of the time, which was the highest success rate among all other Kickstarter campaigns for plays.  

* The second conclusion is that campaigns that has an extremely high campaign goal, ($45,000 or more) had an extremely **Low** success rate of under 20%.

Based on these observations, I would recommend to Louise that she set a campaign goal preferably less than $1,000 or no greater than $4,999 if she really wanted to maximize her chances of having a successful campaign. 

Admittedly, there were campaigns in the $35,000 to $39,999 and the $40,000 to $44,999 ranges that also had very high success rates. I would like to pose that a possible limitation of the visualization is that we don't know about any of the circumstances regarding why those plays were much more successful than other plays that had very high goals. I would suggest modifying this chart to include the "total number of campaings" for each goal range. The reason why there was a spike in the % of successful goals in the $35,000 and $40,000 range could be because there is a smaller sample size of plays in those goal ranges (6 plays).
